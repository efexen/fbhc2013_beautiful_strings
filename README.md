Facebook Hacker Cup 2013 Qualification Beautiful Strings
==========================

Here is the slightly cleaned up version of my FBHC 2013 Qualification round entry for the Beautiful Strings challenge.

Decided to enter this year writing in Ruby, I have included the instructions that were given on the site so you can read through them if you want to read the original spec.

Following files included:
- beautiful_strings.rb    -- My solution code
- competitioninput.txt    -- The input file with real test cases downloaded prior to final submission
- instructions.txt        -- The instructions copied from the FBHC2013 site
- README.md               -- This file
- testinput.txt           -- File with the test cases provided as part of the instructions
 
Usage simply as:
$ruby beautiful_strings.rb testinput.txt output.txt
